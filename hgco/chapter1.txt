sometimes, identical code which works perfectly at my computer doesn't work on others.
this kind of situation happens also in the working environment
in this situation, people who don't understand the computer structure cannot find a clue to solve the problem
a computer is just something hard to understand for those who only know the programming language
in order to analyse the problem and suggest a solution, you have to understand what computer is

even when you have to select the server computer for your service, you need this knowledge
you have to choose the optimal choice in a limited budget
computer structure knowledge is directly related to performance, storage and cost of computer

what's the main topic of computer structure?
1. information a computer understands: two different information (data + instruction)
2. four important components: CPU, memory, secondary storage, I/O device

secondary storage can be considered as an I/O device(outer device that is connected to a computer and exchanges information)
but the only difference is that secondary storage assists memory

components connected to main board can exchange information with each other through bus inside the main board
the most important bus is system bus consists of address/data/control bus

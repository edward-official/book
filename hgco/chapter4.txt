CPU consists of ALU, control unit, register

ALU receives operands through registers and controls from the control unit.
then it performs the operation and outputs the result to the register for a moment not in the memory
that's because it takes a lot of time for CPU to access the memory
this results in a lot of delay of program
ALU also outputs flags to the flag register when needed, for example negative value or overflow and so on

control unit is a part that outputs a control signal which controls devices and interprets an instruction
this control unit can be called as one of the most delicately manufactured device in a computer
that's why every control unit has different inner structures
information that control unit receives
- clock
- instruction
- flag
- control signal from outside of CPU like IO devices
information that control unit outputs
- control towards inside of CPU (ALU, register)
- control towards outside of CPU (IO devices, memory)


different CPU has different registers inside
8 registers to remember
- program counter
- instruction register
- memory address register
- memory buffer register
- general-purpose register
- flag register
- stack pointer
- base register


instruction cycle consists of cycles for fetching, decoding, executing, accessing memory and handling interrupts when a single instruction is processed
an interrupt is a signal that disrupts the normal operation of the cpu
types of interrupts include exceptions and hardware interrupts
an interrupt service routine is a program composed of actions to handle an interrupt

just a little error in a data causes a big problem
not even one percent of error is not permitted in data
that's why managing data is difficult
we call this property "integrity" of data

RDB(Relational Databases)
- it makes data processing faster and safer
- table < schema < database
- RDBMS freed developers from managing all those complicated files (msSQL, oracleDB, mySQL, mariaDB, ...)

not every data is stored in the server's database
for example, data in alarm application
sometimes data is placed in both client and server computer
in this case, process called "synchronization" is required

we have to know where exactly the data we're looking for is located
that's because we have to require the data to the one having the exact data we want
API document can help us to do that

local, internal database, native > client side
API, database > server side

WEB vs APPLICATION
- everytime we access the web pages, we request the pages from the server
- that's why we don't need to update everytime to access the renewed pages for example
- on the other hand, we have to update the application everytime a new version is revealed
- it's easier to renew the web pages than to renew the application
- but it doesn't mean that web page's always better
- web pages are very sensitive to the network
- and applications are less sensitive to the network since part of data is stored in the personal devices

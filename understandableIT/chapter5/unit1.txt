application: program that we download and use
application versions usually have a format of number like 1.0.0
- change on the right number means that the change is small
- change on the middle number means that the change is relatively bigger but still compatible with the lower versions
- change on the left number means that the change is significant, so it is no more compatible with the lower versions

mobile application market: google, apple
- apple: strict criterion of approval but they give you the clear reason of rejection when rejected
- due to some reasons, time needed to get the approval by apple is relatively longer
- that's why apple has smaller number of applications but has better qualities
- google: relatively loose criterion and faster approval

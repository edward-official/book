when you have to work on multiple parts of a project, you can work on different parts separately by git branch
after that we can simply merge
and git alerts us when there's any conflict between those changes of different branches
then we can simply fix that conflicting parts
but completed merge doesn't necessarily mean that the merge is successful
testing process should be done before completion

when many different developers are working on the same project, we need a common workspace to update and share the entire code
that's why we need remote repository like github, bitbucket and so on

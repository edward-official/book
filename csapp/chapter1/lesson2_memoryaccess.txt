[Keyboard Input]
- Data Characteristics: Very small (character-level), irregular, requires immediate response (interrupt)
- Processing Method:
  1. Keyboard controller generates an interrupt → sends signal to CPU
  2. CPU receives the interrupt and executes the OS interrupt handler
  3. Determines which key was pressed and delivers it to the program
- Reason: Immediate processing and interpretation required → CPU involvement is essential

[Disk I/O]
- Data Characteristics: Large (KB~MB), bulk, repetitive
- Processing Method:
  1. CPU gives command to the DMA controller → "Transfer from this address to that address"
  2. DMA controller transfers data directly between disk and memory
  3. Upon completion, DMA generates an interrupt → notifies CPU
- Reason: Inefficient for CPU to move large data directly → DMA handles transfer, CPU only manages

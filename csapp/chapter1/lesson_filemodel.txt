In operating systems: "Everything is a file"

[Core Idea]
- Devices such as keyboards, displays, and networks are all treated as files.
- All input/output is unified in the form of file reading/writing (`read`, `write`).

[Examples]
- Keyboard input   → read() from /dev/keyboard file
- Monitor output   → write() to /dev/tty file
- Network socket   → read()/write() just like a regular file

[Advantages]
1. Consistency: All devices are handled in the same way
2. Simplicity: Programmers don’t need to know complex device-specific operations
3. Flexibility: Redirection (>) allows easily changing the output target
   e.g. echo "hi" > file.txt    (save to file)
        echo "hi" > /dev/tty    (output to screen)
        echo "hi" > /dev/lp0    (output to printer)

[Analogy]
- Every device is a "mailbox of data"
- Programs simply put letters (data) in or take them out

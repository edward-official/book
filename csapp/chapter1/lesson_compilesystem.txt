💻 COMPILE SYSTEM OF C

1. Preprocessor
   - Handles #include, #define, and conditional compilation
   - Output: Preprocessed code (.i)

2. Compiler
   - Converts high-level language → assembly language
   - Output: Assembly code (.s)

3. Assembler
   - Converts assembly → machine code (binary)
   - Output: Object file (.o)
   - Cannot be executed alone (unresolved symbols/addresses)

4. Linker
   - Combines multiple object files + libraries
   - Resolves symbols, relocates addresses, generates executable format
   - Output: Executable file (.exe, a.out, etc.)


💻 Why We Create Object Files Per Source File

Separate Compilation (Compilation Units)
Compiling a large program all at once takes a lot of time.
That’s why source files (main.c, hello.c, math.c, etc.) are compiled independently into object files (.o).

When a file is modified, only that file needs to be recompiled, which makes the build process much faster.

Reusability
Some modules (like math.o) can be reused across multiple projects.
Instead of recompiling from source every time, you can simply reuse the precompiled object file.


💻 The Role of the Linker = “Combine and Complete”

Object files reference each other’s symbols (functions, variables).

- main.o calls hello(), but the definition is in hello.o.
- printf is found in the standard library.

The linker collects all these puzzle pieces and:

- Resolves symbol references (who calls what).
- Performs address relocation so the program can actually run.
- Adds libraries and produces the final executable.

Virtual memory is allocated per process and serves as an abstracted space that utilizes both main memory and disk.  
Therefore, threads within the same process share the same virtual memory.  
Additionally, while the maximum size of each virtual memory is fixed, its actual size is dynamic.  
In virtual memory, the regions occupied by the kernel, text segment, and data segment are fixed, while the remaining space is dynamically shared by the stack, heap, and memory-mapped areas.

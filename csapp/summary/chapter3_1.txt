1. Introduction
- Intel processors are known as x86 and have gone through a long evolution.
- They started as the first 16-bit microprocessors and have evolved into today’s 64-bit multicore processors.
- Along the way, they overcame hardware limitations (memory capacity, address space, etc.) and integrated new features.

2. Major Processor Developments
- 8086 (1978, 29K transistors):
  - Single-chip 16-bit microprocessor.
  - Foundation of the IBM PC, used with MS-DOS.
  - Limited address space (20-bit, 1MB).
  - Floating-point support via external coprocessor (8087).

- 80286 (1982, 134K transistors):
  - Introduced new addressing modes.
  - Used in IBM PC-AT, foundation for MS Windows.

- i386 (1985, 275K transistors):
  - Full 32-bit architecture.
  - Flat memory model, capable of running UNIX and modern Windows.

- i486 (1989, 1.2M transistors):
  - Integrated floating-point unit into the CPU.
  - Performance improved, instruction set largely unchanged.

- Pentium (1993, 3.1M transistors):
  - Performance improvements, minor extensions.

- Pentium Pro (1995, 5.5M transistors):
  - Introduced P6 microarchitecture.
  - Conditional move instruction added.

- Pentium/MMX (1997, 4.5M transistors):
  - Multimedia extension (MMX) instructions.
  - Supported 64-bit vector processing.

- Pentium II (1997, 7M transistors):
  - Continued P6 architecture.

- Pentium III (1999, 8.2M transistors):
  - Introduced SIMD extensions (SSE).
  - Vectorized integer and floating-point operations.

- Pentium 4 (2000, 42M transistors):
  - SSE2 extensions.
  - Floating-point optimization, new data types.

- Pentium 4E (2004, 125M transistors):
  - Hyper-Threading (two programs per chip simultaneously).
  - 64-bit extensions (EM64T) influenced by AMD’s x86-64.

- Core 2 (2006, 291M transistors):
  - Full-scale multicore architecture.
  - No Hyper-Threading support.

- Core i7 Nehalem (2008, 781M transistors):
  - Combined multicore and Hyper-Threading.
  - Each core capable of two threads.

- Core i7 Sandy Bridge (2011, 1.17B transistors):
  - Introduced AVX (256-bit vector operations).

- Core i7 Haswell (2013, 1.4B transistors):
  - AVX2 extensions.
  - Added new instructions and features.

3. Architectural Features
- All generations maintained backward compatibility.
- IA-32 (32-bit) and Intel 64 (64-bit extension of IA-32, also known as x86-64).
- The term x86 comes from the 8086 series naming.

4. Competition with AMD
- AMD produced Intel-compatible CPUs.
- AMD introduced x86-64 first, setting an industry standard.
- Intel later adopted it.

5. Moore’s Law
- Transistor counts double every 18–24 months.
- Predicted by Gordon Moore in 1965.
- Held true for over 30 years in the semiconductor industry.
- Intel processor growth reflects this trend.

6. Summary
- x86 architecture evolved for decades, keeping backward compatibility and gradual expansion.
- New instruction sets (SSE, AVX), multicore, Hyper-Threading, and 64-bit extensions were added over time.
- AMD competition and Moore’s Law were key drivers in CPU development.

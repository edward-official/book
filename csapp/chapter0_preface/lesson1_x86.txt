intel made ISA(Instruction Set Architecture) which is called x86(not an official name) by the people in the industry
and since the moment intel made cross license contract with ibm, amd was able to develop something based on x86 architecture
that's the moment when x86 got bigger thanks to the amd's work to extend it to 64 bits
and now it's considered as a standard in the industry
